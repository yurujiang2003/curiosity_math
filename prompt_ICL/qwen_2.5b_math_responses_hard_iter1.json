Each segment is a chord of the large circle that is tangent to the small circle. The angle between each pair of consecutive segments is \\(75^\\circ\\). We need to find the smallest number of segments \\(n\\) such that the total angle \\(75^\\circ \\times n\\) is a multiple of \\(360^\\circ\\), which means Stuart will have completed a full circle and returned to point \\(A\\).\n\nWe can set up the equation:\n\\[75n = 360k\\]\nwhere \\(n\\) is the number of segments and \\(k\\) is an integer. To find the smallest \\(n\\), we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of \\(75\\) and \\(360\\) divided by \\(75\\).\n\nFirst, we find the prime factorizations of \\(75\\) and \\(360\\):\n\\[75 = 3 \\times 5^2\\]\n\\[360 = 2^3 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 3\\]\n\nThe LCM of \\(75\\) and \\(360\\) is:\n\\[2^3 \\times 3 \\times 5^2 \\times 3 = 1800\\]\n\nSo, the smallest \\(n\\) is:\n\\[n = \\frac{1800}{75} = 24\\]\n\nThus, Stuart will draw \\(24\\) segments before returning to his starting point \\(A\\).\n\nLet's confirm this with Python code to ensure the accuracy of our result.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Function to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers\ndef lcm(a, b):\n    return abs(a * b) // math.gcd(a, b)\n\n# Calculate the LCM of 75 and 360\nlcm_75_360 = lcm(75, 360)\n\n# The number of segments Stuart will draw\nn_segments = lcm_75_360 // 75\nprint(n_segments)\n```\n```output\n24\n```\nThe calculation confirms that Stuart will draw \\(\\boxed{24}\\) segments before returning to his starting point \\(A\\).", "novel_response": "\\[\n         \\boxed{24}\n         \\]\n         \\end{document}\n         \\]", "difficulty": "hard", "iteration": 1}
