This path is known as a \"hypotrochoid\" when the circle rolls around the inside of a polygon. For a triangle, the path traced by the center of a rolling circle of radius 1 is a series of circular arcs. Each arc is centered at a vertex of the triangle and has a radius equal to the distance from the vertex to the center of the circle minus the radius of the rolling circle. Since the rolling circle has a radius of 1, the distance from the center of the circle to each side of the triangle will be 1 unit less than the distance from the vertex to the side. The total distance traveled by the center \\( P \\) of the rolling circle is the sum of the lengths of these arcs.

The center \\(P\\) of the circle will trace a path that is parallel to the sides of the triangle, but shifted inward by the radius of the circle (which is 1). This path is known as the \"locus of the center of the inscribed circle\". The key insight here is that the path traced by the center \\(P\\) of the circle is essentially the perimeter of a smaller triangle that is similar to \\(\\triangle ABC\\) but with each side length reduced by twice the radius of the circle (since the circle is tangent to each side and its radius is 1). The sides of \\(\\triangle ABC\\) are 6, 8, and 10. When the circle rolls around the inside of the triangle, the path of the center \\(P\\) will trace a triangle with sides reduced by \\(2 \\times 1 = 2\\). So, the sides of the triangle traced by \\(P\\) will be \\(6-2=4\\), \\(8-2=6\\), and \\(10-2=8\\). The distance traveled by \\(P\\) is the perimeter of this smaller triangle, which is \\(4 + 6 + 8 = 18\\). However, since the problem asks for the distance traveled when \\(P\\) first returns to its original position, we need to consider the path of \\(P\\) as it rolls around the triangle. The path of \\(P\\) is essentially the perimeter of the smaller triangle, but we need to account for the fact that \\(P\\) travels along the sides of the smaller triangle twice (once for each side it rolls along). Thus, the distance traveled by \\(P\\) is the perimeter of the smaller triangle, which is \\(4 + 6 + 8 = 18\\), but since \\(P\\) travels this path twice (once for each side it rolls along), the total distance traveled by \\(P\\) is \\(18",

      "common_answer": "To solve the problem, we need to find the number of possible arithmetic sequences for the interior angles of a convex hexagon where the angles form an increasing arithmetic sequence, are all less than 150 degrees, and the hexagon is not equiangular. The sum of the interior angles of a hexagon is given by (6-2) \\times 180 = 720 degrees. Let the angles of the hexagon be a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d, a+4d, and a+5d, where a is the first term and d is the common difference of the arithmetic sequence. The sum of these angles is: \\[a + (a+d) + (a+2d) + (a+3d) + (a+4d) + (a+5d) = 6a + 15d = 720.\\] Simplifying, we get: \\[2a + 5d = 240.\\] Since all angles must be less than 150 degrees, we have: \\[a + 5d < 150.\\] We also need to ensure that a > 0 and d > 0 because the hexagon is not equiangular and the angles are increasing. Let's solve this step-by-step using Python to find the possible values of a and d that satisfy these conditions. First, we'll iterate over possible values of d and check if the corresponding value of a is a positive integer and if all angles are less than 150 degrees. ```python # Initialize a counter for the number of valid sequences count = 0 # Iterate over possible values of d for d in range(1, 48): # d must be a positive integer and 5d < 150, so d < 30 # Calculate the corresponding value of a if (240 - 5 * d) % 2 == 0: a = (240 - 5 * d) // 2 # Check if a is a positive integer and all angles are less than 150 degrees if a > 0 and a + 5 * d < 150: count += 1 print(count) ``` ```output",
      "novel_answer": "To solve the problem, we need to find the possible sequences of the interior angles of a convex hexagon that form an increasing arithmetic sequence.

This simplifies to \\(2a + 5d = 240\\). 4. **Constraints:** - Each angle must be a positive integer less than \\(150^\\circ\\). - The hexagon is not equiangular, so \\(d \\neq 0\\). 5. **Finding Possible Values:** From \\(2a + 5d = 240\\), we can express \\(a\\) in terms of \\(d\\): \\[ a = \\frac{240 - 5d}{2} \\] For \\(a\\) to be an integer, \\(240 - 5d\\) must be even, so \\(d\\) must be even.

The unicorn has pulled the rope taut, the end of the rope is 4 feet from the nearest point on the tower, and the length of the rope that is touching the tower is \\(\\frac{a-\\sqrt{b}}{c}\\) feet, where \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are positive integers, and \\(c\\) is prime. First, let's visualize the problem. The rope forms a right triangle with the height of 16 feet (20 feet - 4 feet) and the horizontal distance of 4 feet.

We have a square flag. 2. There is a red cross of uniform width with a blue square in the center. 3. The entire cross (both the red arms and the blue center) takes up 36% of the area of the flag. We need to determine what percent of the area of the flag is blue. Let's break down the problem step-by-step: 1. **Define Variables:** - Let the side length of the square flag be \\( s \\). - Let the width of the cross be \\( w \\). 2. **Area Calculations:** - The total area of the flag is \\( s^2 \\). - The area of the cross includes the blue square in the center and the red arms. - The blue square in the center has side length \\( s - 2w \\) (since the cross width is \\( w \\) on each side). - The area of the blue square is \\( (s - 2w)^2 \\). - The area of the cross (including the red arms) is 36% of the total area, which is \\( 0.36s^2 \\). 3. **Equations:** - The area of the cross (red arms plus blue square) can be expressed as: \\[ (s - 2w)^2 + 4 \\cdot (s - w) \\cdot w = 0.36s^2 \\] - Simplify and solve for \\( w \\) in terms of \\( s \\). 4. **Solve for \\( w \\):** - Substitute \\( w \\) back into the area equations to find the percentage of the blue area. Let's implement this in Python using sympy to solve for \\( w \\) and then find the percentage of the blue area. ```python import sympy as sp # Define variables s, w = sp.symbols('s w') # Total area of the flag total_area = s**2 # Area of the blue square in the center blue_area = (s - 2*w)**2 #",

      "common_answer": "To solve this problem, we will use mass points, a technique that simplifies the problem of finding ratios in geometric figures. Here's the step-by-step reasoning: 1. **Assign Mass Points:** - Since \\(\\frac{CD}{DB} = \\frac{3}{1}\\), we can assign a mass of 1 to point \\(B\\) and a mass of 3 to point \\(D\\). Since \\(D\\) is on \\(CB\\) and divides it in the ratio 3:1, the mass at \\(C\\) must be 1 (since \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)). - Since \\(\\frac{AE}{EB} = \\frac{3}{2}\\), we can assign a mass of 2 to point \\(A\\) and a mass of 3 to point \\(E\\). Since \\(E\\) is on \\(AB\\) and divides it in the ratio 3:2, the mass at \\(B\\) must be 2 (since \\(2 + 3 = 5\\)). 2. **Find the Mass at Point \\(P\\):** - Since \\(P\\) is the intersection of \\(CE\\) and \\(AD\\), we need to find the mass at \\(P\\). The mass at \\(P\\) can be determined by considering the masses at the points through which the cevians pass. - The mass at \\(P\\) from the perspective of \\(CE\\) is the sum of the masses at \\(C\\) and \\(E\\), which is \\(1 + 3 = 4\\). - The mass at \\(P\\) from the perspective of \\(AD\\) is the sum of the masses at \\(A\\) and \\(D\\), which is \\(2 + 3 = 5\\). 3. **Calculate the Ratio \\(r = \\frac{CP}{PE}\\):** - The ratio \\(r\\) is the ratio of the masses at \\(E\\) and \\(C\\), which is \\(\\frac{3}{1} = 3\\). So, the value of \\(r\\) is \\(3\\). Let's confirm this with Python and sympy: ```python # We can use sympy to confirm the mass point solution from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve # Define the masses mass_A = 2 mass_B = 1 mass_C = 1 mass_D = 3 mass_E = 3 # The mass at point P from",

The idea is to assign \"masses\" to the points of the triangle in such a way that the ratios of the segments are preserved. Here's the step-by-step solution: 1. Assign a mass to point \\(B\\). Let's assign a mass of 2 to \\(B\\). Since \\(\\frac{AE}{EB} = \\frac{3}{2}\\), the mass at \\(A\\) should be 3 to balance the mass at \\(B\\), so the mass at \\(E\\) will be \\(3 + 2 = 5\\). 2. Since \\(\\frac{CD}{DB} = \\frac{3}{1}\\), the mass at \\(D\\) should be \\(2 + 3 \\cdot 3 = 11\\) (since the mass at \\(C\\) should balance the mass at \\(D\\)). The mass at \\(C\\) should be 3 times the mass at \\(D\\), so the mass at \\(C\\) is \\(3 \\cdot 3 = 9\\). 3. The mass at \\(P\\) (the intersection of \\(CE\\) and \\(AD\\)) can be determined by considering the masses on \\(CE\\) and \\(AD\\). The mass at \\(P\\) from \\(CE\\) is the sum of the masses at \\(C\\) and \\(E\\), which is \\(9 + 5 = 14\\). The mass at \\(P\\) from \\(AD\\) is the sum of the masses at \\(A\\) and \\(D\\), which is \\(3 + 11 = 14\\). Since the masses are equal, the ratio \\(\\frac{CP}{PE}\\) is the ratio of the masses at \\(E\\) and \\(C\\), which is \\(\\frac{5}{9}\\).",

The side length of each equilateral triangle is the same as the side length of the hexagon. Given that \\(PAD\\) is an equilateral triangle with side length 8, the side length of the hexagon \\(ABCDEF\\) is also 8. The area of an equilateral triangle with side length \\(s\\) is given by: \\[ \\text{Area of one equilateral triangle} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 \\] Since the hexagon is made up of 6 such triangles, the area of the hexagon \\(A_{\\text{hex}}\\) is: \\[ A_{\\text{hex}} = 6 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\times 8^2 = 6 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\times 64 = 6 \\times 16\\sqrt{3} = 96\\sqrt{3} \\] ### Step 2: Determine the height of the pyramid The apex \\(P\\) of the pyramid is directly above the center \\(O\\) of the hexagon. The distance from the center of the hexagon to one of its vertices (the radius of the circumscribed circle) is equal to the side length of the hexagon, which is 8. The height \\(h\\) of the pyramid can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle formed by the height \\(h\\), the radius of the circumscribed circle (8), and the side length of the equilateral triangle \\(PAD\\) (8). The height \\(h\\) of the pyramid is the other leg of this right triangle, and the hypotenuse is 8. So: \\[ 8^2 = h^2 + 8^2 \\implies h^2 = 8^2 - 8^2 = 0 \\",

This implies that \\( P \\) must lie inside the incircle of \\( \\triangle ABC \\). The area of the set of all fold points of \\( \\triangle ABC \\) is the area of the incircle of \\( \\triangle ABC \\). Given: - \\( AB = 36 \\) - \\( AC = 72 \\) - \\( \\angle B = 90^\\circ \\) First, we can determine the length of \\( BC \\) using the Pythagorean theorem: \\[ BC = \\sqrt{AC^2 - AB^2} = \\sqrt{72^2 - 36^2} = \\sqrt{5184 - 1296} = \\sqrt{3888} = 36\\sqrt{3} \\] Next, we need to find the radius \\( r \\) of the incircle.

Here's the step-by-step approach: 1. **Understand the Geometry:** - The original square has a side length of 10. - Two congruent equilateral triangles are drawn such that they share one side and each has one vertex on a vertex of the square. This means the triangles are positioned in such a way that they split the square into three regions: two triangular regions and one rectangular region in the middle. 2. **Determine the Height of the Equilateral Triangles:** - The side length of the equilateral triangles is the same as the side length of the square, which is 10. - The height \\(h\\) of an equilateral triangle with side length \\(s\\) is given by \\(h = \\frac{s \\sqrt{3}}{2}\\). So, the height of each triangle is \\(5\\sqrt{3}\\). 3. **Determine the Dimensions of the Inner Square:** - The height of the two triangles together is \\(10\\sqrt{3}\\). - The side length of the inner square is the side length of the original square minus the height of the two triangles. This is because the inner square is positioned in the middle of the square, and the triangles occupy the top and bottom regions. - The side length of the inner square is \\(10 - (10\\sqrt{3} - 10) = 10(2 - \\sqrt{3})\\).

Let's denote the lengths of the sides as follows: - \\(AB = a\\) - \\(BC = b\\) - \\(CD = c\\) - \\(DA = d\\) Since \\(B\\) and \\(D\\) are right angles, we can use the Pythagorean theorem in the triangles \\(ABC\\) and \\(CDA\\): \\[ AB^2 + BC^2 = AC^2 \\implies a^2 + b^2 = 9 \\] \\[ CD^2 + DA^2 = AC^2 \\implies c^2 + d^2 = 9 \\] We are given that \\(ABCD\\) has two sides with distinct integer lengths.

      "novel_answer": "To find the area of the intersection of the two circles, we can use geometric properties and integration. However, for this specific problem, we can use a more straightforward geometric approach. The two circles are centered at \\((2,0)\\) and \\((0,2)\\) with a radius of 2. The distance between the centers of the two circles is \\(2\\sqrt{2}\\), which is equal to the radius of each circle. This means that the two circles intersect at two points and form a lens-shaped intersection. The area of the intersection of the two circles can be found by calculating the area of the two circular segments and adding them together. 1. Calculate the area of one circular segment. 2. Multiply by 2 to get the total area of the intersection. The formula for the area of a circular segment is: \\[ A_{\\text{segment}} = \\frac{1}{2} r^2 (\\theta - \\sin \\theta) \\] where \\( \\theta \\) is the central angle between the two radii to the intersection points. In this case, the central angle \\( \\theta \\) can be found using the cosine rule in the triangle formed by the centers of the circles and one of the intersection points. The triangle is an isosceles right triangle with sides of length 2 and a hypotenuse of \\(2\\sqrt{2}\\). Therefore, the angle \\( \\theta \\) is \\(90^\\circ\\) or \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) radians.

      "common_answer": "To solve this problem, we need to understand how the volumes of the slices of the cone are distributed. When a right circular cone is sliced into four pieces by planes parallel to its base, each slice will have a height that is a fraction of the total height of the cone. Since all slices have the same height, the volume of each slice will be proportional to the volume of a cone with the same height but with a different base radius. The volume \\( V \\) of a cone is given by the formula: \\[ V = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h \\] where \\( r \\) is the radius of the base and \\( h \\) is the height of the cone. If we slice the cone into four pieces of equal height, the height of each slice will be \\( \\frac{h}{4} \\). The radius of the base of each slice will be proportional to the height from the vertex of the cone.

      "common_answer": "To solve the problem, we need to understand the conditions for a point X to be n-ray partitional. For a point X to be n-ray partitional, it must be such that n rays emanating from X divide the unit square into n triangles of equal area. This implies that the point X must be such that the lines from X to the sides of the square intersect the sides at points that divide the sides into segments whose lengths are in a specific ratio. For a point X to be n-ray partitional, n must be divisible by 4 because the unit square has 4 sides and the rays must divide the square symmetrically. So, n must be a multiple of 4. The number of points that are 100-ray partitional but not 60-ray partitional can be determined by counting the points that satisfy the conditions for 100-ray partitional but do not satisfy the conditions for 60-ray partitional. Since 100 and 60 are both multiples of 4, we need to consider the grid points that are part of the 100-ray partitional grid but not part of the 60-ray partitional grid. The number of points in an n-ray partitional grid is given by (n-1)^2. So, the number of points that are 100-ray partitional is (100-1)^2 = 99^2 = 9801. The number of points that are 60-ray partitional is (60-1)^2 = 59^2 = 3481.
