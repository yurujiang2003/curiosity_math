Now, it is clear that $GB = DE + 1 = 4x + 1$, so $AH = AG = 8 - GB = 7 - 4x$ since $AH$ and $AG$ are both tangent to the circle P at some point.

The side lengths of the smaller triangles are proportional to \\(s\\).\n\n3. **Determine the Proportions:**\n   - The side lengths of the smaller triangles are proportional to \\(s\\), and the areas are proportional to \\(s^2\\). The area of the other smaller right triangle can be expressed as \\(k \\cdot s^2\\), where \\(k\\) is a constant to be determined.\n\n4. **Use Similarity and Proportions:**\n   - Since the triangles are similar, the ratio of the areas of the triangles is the same as the ratio of the squares of the corresponding sides. The side lengths of the smaller triangles are proportional to \\(s\\), so the areas are proportional to \\(s^2\\).\n\n5. **Calculate the Ratio:**\n   - The area of the original triangle is \\(\\frac{1}{2}ab\\). The sum of the areas of the square and the two smaller triangles is equal to the area of the original triangle. So, we have:\n     \\[\n     s^2 + m \\cdot s^2 + k \\cdot s^2 = \\frac{1}{2}ab\n     \\]\n     Simplifying, we get:\n     \\[\n     (1 + m + k)s^2 = \\frac{1}{2}ab\n     \\]\n     Since the triangles are similar, the areas are proportional to the square of the corresponding sides. The side lengths of the smaller triangles are proportional to \\(s\\), so the areas are proportional to \\(s^2\\). The ratio of the areas of the two smaller triangles is the same as the ratio of the squares of the corresponding sides. Therefore"}

Let's break down the problem step-by-step and use Python with SymPy to verify our solution.\n\n1. **Understand the Geometry:**\n   - We are given an acute triangle $ABC$ with $\\angle BAC = 61^\\circ$ and $\\angle ABC = 73^\\circ$.\n   - The altitudes $\\overline{AX}$ and $\\overline{BY}$ intersect at the orthocenter $H$.\n   - We need to find $\\angle CHX$.\n\n2. **Find the Measure of $\\angle ACB$:**\n   Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is $180^\\circ$, we can find $\\angle ACB$ as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\angle ACB = 180^\\circ - \\angle BAC - \\angle ABC = 180^\\circ - 61^\\circ - 73^\\circ = 46^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n3. **Use the Orthocenter Property:**\n   In any triangle, the measure of the angle formed by a side and the altitude from the opposite vertex is equal to the measure of the angle formed by the same side and the altitude from the adjacent vertex. This means that $\\angle CHX = \\angle ACB$.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   Therefore, $\\angle CHX = 46^\\circ$.\n\nLet's confirm this with a simple Python script using SymPy.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the angles\nangle_BAC = 61\nangle_ABC = 73\n\n# Calculate the angle ACB\nangle_ACB = 180 - angle_BAC - angle_ABC\n\n# The angle CHX is equal to angle ACB\nangle_CHX = angle_ACB\n\nprint(angle_CHX)\n```\n```output\n46\n```\nThe measure of angle $\\angle CHX$ in the given triangle $ABC$ is \\(\\boxed{46^\\circ}\\).\n\nA school bought 20 cartons of pencils at the start of school.

Since the height of this trapezoid is $12$, and $AC$ extends a distance of $5$ on either direction of $A'C'$, we can use a 5-12-13 triangle to determine that $AA' = CC' = 13$.\nNow, we wish to find a point equidistant from $A$, $A'$, and $C$. By symmetry, this point, namely $X$, must lie on the perpendicular bisector of $AC$. Let $X$ be $h$ units from $A'C'$ in $ACC'A'$.

Depending on the location of $X$, the number of rays distributed among these four triangular sectors will vary. We start by finding the corner-most point that is $100$-ray partitional (let this point be the bottom-left-most point).\nWe first draw the four rays that intersect the vertices. At this point, the triangular sectors with bases as the sides of the square that the point is closest to both do not have rays dividing their areas. Therefore, their heights are equivalent since their areas are equal. The remaining $96$ rays are divided among the other two triangular sectors, each sector with $48$ rays, thus dividing these two sectors into $49$ triangles of equal areas.\nLet the distance from this corner point to the closest side be $a$ and the side of the square be $s$. From this, we get the equation $\\frac{a\\times s}{2}=\\frac{(s-a)\\times s}{2}\\times\\frac1{49}$. Solve for $a$ to get $a=\\frac s{50}$. Therefore, point $X$ is $\\frac1{50}$ of the side length away from the two sides it is closest to. By moving $X$ $\\frac s{50}$ to the right, we also move one ray from the right sector to the left sector, which determines another $100$-ray partitional point. We can continue moving $X$ right and up to derive the set of points that are $100$-ray partitional.\nIn the end, we get a square grid of points each $\\frac s{50}$ apart from one another. Since this grid ranges from a distance of $\\frac s{50}$ from one side to $\\frac{49s}{50}$ from the same side, we have a $49\\times49$ grid, a total of $2401$ $100$-ray partitional points. To find the overlap from the $60$-ray partitional, we must find the distance from the corner-most $60$-ray partitional point to the sides closest to it. Since the $100$-ray partitional points form a $49\\times49$ grid, each point $\\frac s{50}$ apart from each other, we can deduce that the $60$-ray partitional points form a $29\\times29$ grid, each point $\\frac s{30}$ apart from each other. To find the overlap points, we must find the common divisors of $30$ and $50$ which are $1, 2, 5,$ and $10$. Therefore, the overlapping points will form grids with points $s$, $\\frac s{2}$, $\\frac s{5}$, and $\\frac s{10}$ away from each other respectively. Since the grid with points $\\frac s{10}$ away from each other includes the other points, we can disregard the other grids.

Look at both sides; we can know that $a$ has to be a multiple of $1369$ and not of $3$ and it's reasonable to think that $b$ is divisible by $3$ so that we can cancel out the $3$ on the right side of the equation.\nLet's see if $x = \\frac {1369}{3}$ fits.

Hence $x = 1369/3$.\nHence the perimeter is $1225*2 + 144*2 + \\frac {1369}{3} *2 = 1369* \\frac {8}{3}$, and $BC$ is $1369$.
